# VagueAgency

VagueAgency aims to be an incredibly versatile bot; our goal is to have every feature you could ever think of, as well as some you would never even imagine. The overall vision of VagueAgency is to provide the user with a quality product. Unlike many of the "big name" Discord bots, VagueAgency will never integrate any "pay to unlock" commands, or anything else that requires monetary compensation in exchange for basic functionality. VagueAgency was built from the ground up on a foundation based on user satisfaction. The user experience is our top priority, because without the userbase, this bot would not exist.
